const { createClient } = require('@supabase/supabase-js');
const client = createClient(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY);

const schema = \`
-- [Paste contents of sql/pricing-schema.sql here]
\`;

client.rpc('exec_sql', { sql: schema }).then(({ data, error }) => {
  if (error) console.error('Error:', error);
  else console.log('Schema created successfully');
});
"
```

### 2. Run the RLS Policies
```bash
# Execute the RLS policies
node -e "
const { createClient } = require('@supabase/supabase-js');
const client = createClient(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY);

const rls = \`
-- [Paste contents of sql/pricing-rls.sql here]
\`;

client.rpc('exec_sql', { sql: rls }).then(({ data, error }) => {
  if (error) console.error('Error:', error);
  else console.log('RLS policies created successfully');
});
"
```

## Cron Job Setup
